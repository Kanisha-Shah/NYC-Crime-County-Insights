We embark on our analytical journey by examining the evolving landscape of crime rates over the years. Our primary focus centers around the state of New York, where we delve into the occurrence of major heinous crimes. Through visual storytelling, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that may lie within the data sets, shedding light on the dynamic nature of criminal activities in this region.

As we delved into our analysis, a noticeable surge in major crimes emerged, casting a spotlight on incidents unfolding across the vibrant landscape of New York City. This trend is vividly captured in the graph below : 


### New York State Insights 
```{r,fig.width=50, fig.height=30,echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Data Needs to be rolled up at the total level 

subset_NYC <-  subset_df %>%
  filter(Region != "Non-New York City")


p_opt<-ggplot(subset_df, aes(x=Year, y=Index_Total, group=County))+ geom_line(aes(color=County))+ geom_point(aes(color=County)) +xlab("Year") + ylab("Total Crimes") + ggtitle(" TOTAL NEW YORK STATE INSIGHTS ")
                                                                            
ggplotly(p_opt)
```

A notable observation emerges as we scrutinize the data—over the span of a decade, crimes in each borough have witnessed a remarkable reduction, nearly halving. This trend persists, indicating a consistent decline in the subsequent decade as well. The numbers tell a story of positive change and enhanced safety across the diverse neighborhoods of New York City.

Observing the depicted graph, we discern a nuanced narrative within the vibrant tapestry of New York City. This intricate story unfolds across the four prominent boroughs — New York, Queens, Bronx, and Kings. Each borough contributes its unique thread to the fabric of major crimes, revealing a compelling tale of urban dynamics and safety patterns.

Based on the data, a significant portion, accounting for 40%, of the reported incidents is occurring within the bustling streets of New York City. This statistic highlights the concentration of activities and underscores the need for a focused examination of the city's safety dynamics.

### New York City Insights 
```{r,fig.width=50, fig.height=30,echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Looking at the data the highest number of the crime is taking place at the the New York City in the five borough  so lets have a closer look at the  New York City 


#subset_NYC <-  subset_df %>%
 # filter(Region != "Non-New York City")

subset_NYC <-  subset_df %>%
  filter(County %in% c("Bronx", "New York", "Richmond", "Queens", "Kings"))

ggplotly(p_opt_NNYC)
```

Now, let's delve deeper into the specifics of the types of crimes that have been unfolding over the years. By examining the trends, we aim to unravel the patterns and gain insights into the nature of incidents.In the graph below, we illuminate the major categories of crimes, particularly those classified as property and violent offenses. The visual representation spans across time, offering insights into the unfolding trends of these crime types. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Lets look at the overall picture of the Total crime in New York

  pivot_longer(cols = c('Violent_Total', 'Property_Total'), names_to = "Category", values_to = "Freq") %>%
  mutate(Region_type = ifelse(Region == "New York City", "NYC", "Non-New York City")) %>%
  group_by(Year, Region_type, Category) %>%
  summarize(Freq = sum(Freq), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ungroup()

# Lets deep Dive into into the reasons


Pivot_longer_reasons <- subset_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Murder", "Rape", "Robbery", "Aggravated_Assault"), names_to = "Category", values_to = "Freq") %>%
  mutate(Region_type = ifelse(County == "Bronx", "Bronx", 
                      ifelse(County == "Kings", "Kings",

       x = "Crimes",
       y = "COUNTY") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))

```


Our analysis spotlights areas of concern within New York City, indicating that Bronx and Kings exhibit a higher prevalence of violent crimes. Following closely are New York and Queens, raising awareness about the safety dynamics in these regions.

Socioeconomic Factors says: The Bronx has faced significant socioeconomic challenges, including high poverty rates, unemployment, and inadequate access to quality education and healthcare. These factors can contribute to higher crime rates.

### Deep Dive into Property Crimes over years

```{r,fig.width=10, fig.height=10,echo=FALSE, comment=NA, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Pivot_longer_reasons_p <- subset_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Burglary", "Larceny", "Motor_Vehicle_Theft"), names_to = "Category", values_to = "Freq") %>%
  mutate(Region_type = ifelse(County == "Bronx", "Bronx", 
                      ifelse(County == "Kings", "Kings", 
                      ifelse(County == "New York", "New York", 
                      ifelse(County == "Queens", "Queens", 
                      ifelse(County == "Richmond", "Richmond", NA)))))) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(Year, Region_type, Category) %>%
  summarize(Freq = sum(Freq), .groups = "drop") %>%
  ungroup()



ggplot(Pivot_longer_reasons_p, aes(x = Region_type, y = Freq, fill = Category )) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~Year)+
  labs(title = "Property Crimes",
       x = "Crimes",
       y = "COUNTY") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```
Our analysis identifies that Larceny stands out as the primary contributor to property crime rates.
In our analysis, we observe that among property crimes, Burglary and Motor Vehicle Theft are notable contributors. These two categories warrant closer scrutiny to comprehend the factors influencing their occurrence and to develop targeted strategies aimed at reducing these specific types of property-related incidents.
