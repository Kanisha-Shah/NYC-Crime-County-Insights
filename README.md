Criminal Analysis Final Project

Our project delves into intriguing questions surrounding crime statistics, exploring their evolution over the years and discernible patterns across New York counties. From understanding the variation in adult arrest rates and its correlation with demographic makeup to identifying predominant index crimes and evaluating law enforcement contributions, our journey through the data unveils surprising insights and expected trends. We've compiled our findings into a neat and accessible bookdown format.
